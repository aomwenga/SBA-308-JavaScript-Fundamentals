// the ID of the learner for which this data has been collected
// "id": number,

// the learnerâ€™s total, weighted average, in which assignments
// with more points_possible should be counted for more
// e.g. a learner with 50/100 on one assignment and 190/200 on another
// would have a weighted average score of 240/300 = 80%.
// "avg": number,

// console.log(assignments.points_possible);

// each assignment should have a key with its ID,
// and the value associated with it should be the percentage that
// the learner scored on the assignment (submission.score / points_possible)
// <assignment_id>: number,
// if an assignment is not yet due, it should not be included in either
// the average or the keyed dictionary of scores

// average score with >= total of submitted assignments by learner otherwise error
// check dates of assigmnets
